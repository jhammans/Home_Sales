# Home Sales Data Analysis

This repository contains Python notebooks and partitioned datasets for analyzing home sales data. The project demonstrates techniques for data processing, querying to extract insights from real estate data.

## Project Structure

- **`Home_Sales.ipynb`**: The main Jupyter notebook that provides an in-depth analysis of the home sales dataset, using Python libraries like findspark and pyspark.sql.
  
- **`Home_Sales_colab.ipynb`**: A version of the notebook optimized for Google Colab, ensuring easier execution in a cloud environment without local setup.

- **`home_sales_partitioned/`**: A folder containing partitioned datasets used in the analysis.

- **`Starter_Code/`**: Initial files and templates for running the project or conducting your own analysis.

- **`.gitignore`**: Specifies files and folders ignored by version control.

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed along with the following libraries:
   - Jupyter Notebook
   - findspark
   - pyspark

2. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jhammans/Home_Sales.git
   cd Home_Sales
   ```

3. **Run the Notebook**:
   - Open `Home_Sales.ipynb` locally or in Jupyter Lab/Notebook.
   - Alternatively, use `Home_Sales_colab.ipynb` for Google Colab.

## Key Features

- **Data Partitioning**: The repository includes partitioned datasets, facilitating data filtering and selection for targeted analysis.
  
- **Real Estate Insights**: Extract valuable information from the dataset, such as average sales prices, trends, and distribution of properties.

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Run the analysis either locally or on Google Colab without additional setup.
